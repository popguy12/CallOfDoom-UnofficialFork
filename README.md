# Call of DooM Unofficial Fork
A fork of ArrowWoods Call of DooM mod, aimed at polishing the framework mechanics,
improving gunplay and feedback, and improving the visual representation of the mod.

In part an effort to make a solid foundation for if Arrowwood would like to use
for any further development in the future.

Following as he stated himself in his ModDB post alongside the mod:

> This MOD is like a personal toy box that I have prepared for my own use.
> Only people who find this toy box fun should play this.
> I ignore all external criticism. If you have any criticisms about the content

As it stands, I have held Arrowwoods work in high regard due to understanding
just how much time and effort actually goes into caputring and editing every
individual frame of animation, on top of completely understanding where he is
coming from about critics and the like, having witnessed the bullshit that
happened in that ZDooM thread years back. I hope that this does not come off as
spiteful or rude or anything of the sort.

I just hope to be able to provide said technology to make further development of
his mod easier, while allowing more mechanics and stuff to be added as well.
